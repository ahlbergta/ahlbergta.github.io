The user starts in the center of the room and can see a blue screen on the tv with instructions on how to navigate the 3D environment.

There are markings on the wall showing interactive objects. The user must hover over a switch in order to activate or deactivate it. By default the lights are on and the fan is turned off.

When the fan is turned on, the switch flips up and the fan rotates indefinitely until the switch is turned off again.

The lights turn off when the light switch is in the down position. The switch toggles both an actual point light in the ceiling fan and a emissive material applied to a bulb mesh within the ceiling fan.
